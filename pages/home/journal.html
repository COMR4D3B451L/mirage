        Clinihub Portal - Integrated Medical Records and Journaling System.
      </h1>
      <p class="text-xl my-8">
        Our medical journaling system is a tool that helps doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals at private clinics to manage patient care in a more efficient, modular, and organized way. The portal connects directly to the patient platform app Clinihub allowing better communication between the patient and the clinic before and after the visit. The portal will allow the clinic to create full a "Patient Journey" for each treatment they provide. The system also uses artificial intelligence to summarize and enhance consultations, making it easier for doctors to quickly review and understand important information. Other features include managing appointments, conduct consultations, collect consent forms, and keep track of treatment, lab reports, and more.
